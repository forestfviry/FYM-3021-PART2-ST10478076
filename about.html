      The history of the website starts with the creator “Mniac”. 
      The brand was started in the year 2022, with just one teenage boy who wanted to make a difference in the South African creative and clothing industry. 
      There were not that many brands that took teenagers into consideration. 
      Only a plethora of clothes were targeted to young children, toddlers, babies, adults as well as tweens but never to teenagers. 
      This brand was born to have teenagers and youth have a singular brand they can purchase from. With high quality hoodies, shirts and Sports-Wear, 
      FYM3021 was the foundation to teenagers in South Africa and all around the world. This brand was born to merge clothing and creativity into a singular aspect, 
      despite the fast-pacing growth in trends and popularity. FYM3021 paved its way in staying relevant through young, teenage South African models, 
      rappers and creators making it popular amongst youth.

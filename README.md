One of the most noticeable changes I made throughout my code was the refinement of my website’s visual identity. From the start, my project already featured a bold, modern dark theme, but the 
updates I implemented strengthened the sense of brand professionalism, consistency, and user engagement. One of the biggest visual improvements I introduced was the shrinking header animation. Previously, the 
header remained static and took up the same amount of space regardless of how far a user scrolled. By adding a subtle shrinking effect, the header now compresses as the user scrolls down, creating a more modern, 
responsive feel while keeping the logo and navigation visible at all times. This updated interaction not only enhances the visual appeal but also gives the site a more premium, app-like 
experience. I also upgraded the header by adding transparency, a softer glass-like texture, and smooth animation effects. Even though I kept the original black-and-grey palette, the addition of a frosted-glass touch modernized the layout without moving away from my existing brand aesthetic. These enhancements show how I began thinking more intentionally about UX design—finding a balance 
between maintaining my brand’s identity and adding modern styling cues seen on high-end fashion and tech websites. Another improvement I made was upgrading my favicon setup. Instead of 
relying on a single PNG file, which can look inconsistent or blurry across devices, I expanded this into a complete favicon block with multiple sizes and formats. This ensures that my brand logo displays sharply on tabs, bookmarks, and even mobile home screens. This small but meaningful change enhances professionalism and strengthens the visual presence of my brand across the web. 
A major area where I made progress was in organising and structuring my code more professionally. One of the most significant improvements was moving 
my JavaScript from inline <script> tags to clean, dedicated external files. Instead of embedding my header animation script directly in the HTML, I placed 
it into an external JavaScript file (header.js). This reflects a shift towards best practices by separating structure, design, and behaviour. It makes my website easier to 
maintain, reuse, and scale as it grows. I also improved the structure and clarity of my CSS. Without changing the original layout or theme, I added a new shrink class specifically to animate the header 
during scrolling. This class controls padding, logo size, and transitions. By extending my existing style system rather than rewriting it from scratch, I showed a more methodical, modular approach to CSS—something that will be valuable in future projects. Throughout my stylesheet, I maintained the original colour scheme and design choices but added polished touches, such as smoother transitions and more 
cohesive animations. My hover effects, text animations, and responsive adjustments now blend more naturally with the rest of the site. These improvements show a stronger understanding of how to keep code readable 
and organized while still enhancing visual quality. I also improved my <head> section to include proper SEO and metadata. By adding refined descriptions, keywords, viewport settings, and complete.
